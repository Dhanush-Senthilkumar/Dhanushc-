//Though there have been more successful pirates, Stoneheart is one of the best-known and widely-feared of his time . He commanded four ships and had a pirate army of 300 at the height of his career, and defeated the famous warship, HMS “Scarborough” in sea-battle. He was known for barreling into battle clutching two swords, with several knives and pistols at the ready. He captured over forty merchant ships in the Caribbean, and without flinching killed many prisoners. Stoneheart and his three pirates found a treasure of gold coins Short Fin too joined them. They decided to share the treasure. Stoneheart agreed to give x % share for Short Fin. He then decided to take y % share from the remaining treasure. His other pirates willl share equally the remaining gold coins. Write a program to compute their share's. //
