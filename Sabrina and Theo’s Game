//Sabrina and Theo were friends. They felt very bored and decided to play a game with calendar and number of days. Sabrina will give the month and the year as input, and Theo wants to find the number of days in that month. Write a C program using switch case and help Sabrina to find the answer. You should check whether the given year is a leap year. If it is a leap year it will have 29 days in February.//
