//Mrs.Raja is a miser to the core.She saves money even on petite things. One dayshe heard a discount offer announced in a shop. she wants to purchase lot of items to save her money. The discount is given only when atleast two items are bought. Since each item has different discount prices , she finds difficult to check the amount she has saved. So she approaches you to device a automated discount calculator to make her easy while billing.//
